🌟 Featured Projects:

Red Valley Festival - Digital Marketing Campaign:
As part of a Digital Marketing Bootcamp, I developed a comprehensive marketing strategy for the Red Valley Festival in Olbia. This project was designed as a symbolic case study, where I integrated user-generated content with brand storytelling to create a strong online community around the festival. By utilizing a multi-channel approach across social platforms and engaging influencers, the campaign achieved a theoretical 25% boost in engagement and a notable increase in ticket sales.
